            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>SOME REFLECTIONS On his Majeſty's PROCLAMATION Of the 12<hi rend="sup">th</hi> of February 1686/7 for <hi>a Toleration</hi> in <hi>Scotland,</hi> together with the ſaid <hi>Proclamation.</hi>
            </head>
            <p n="1">I. THe Preamble of a <hi>Proclamation,</hi> is oft writ in haſt, and is the flourish of ſome wanton Pen: but one of ſuch an Extraordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary nature as <hi>this is,</hi> was proba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly more ſeverely examined; there is a new deſignation of his <hi>Majeſties Authority</hi> here ſet forth of his <hi>Abſolute Power,</hi> which is ſo often repeated, that it deſerves to be a little ſearched into. <hi>Prerogative Royal,</hi> and <hi>Soveraign Authority,</hi> are Termes already received and known; but for this <hi>Abſolute Power,</hi> as it is a new Term, ſo thoſe who have coined it, may make it ſignify what they will. The <hi>Roman Law</hi> ſpeaks of <hi>Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceps Legibus ſolutus,</hi> and <hi>Abſolute</hi> in its na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural ſignification, importing the being without all Ties and Reſtraints; then the true meaning of this ſeems to be, that there is an <hi>Inherent Power</hi> in the <hi>King,</hi> which can neither be reſtrained by <hi>Lawes, Promiſes,</hi> nor <hi>Oaths;</hi> for nothing leſs than the being <hi>free</hi> from all theſe, renders a <hi>Power Abſolute.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="2">II. If the former Term ſeemed to ſtretch our Allegeance, that which comes after it, is yet a ſtep of another nature, tho one can hardly imagine what can go beyond <hi>Abſolute Power;</hi> and it is in theſe Words, <hi>Which all our Subjects are to obey with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out reſerve.</hi> And this is the carrying obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience many ſiſes beyond what the <hi>Grand Seigneur</hi> has ever yet claimed: For all <hi>Princes,</hi> even the moſt Violent pretenders to <hi>Abſolute Power,</hi> till <hi>Lewis the Great's</hi> time, have thought it enough to oblige their <hi>Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects</hi> to ſubmit to their <hi>Power,</hi> and to bear whatſoever they thought good to impoſe upon them; but till the Days of the late <hi>Converſions</hi> by the <hi>Dragoons,</hi> it was never ſo much as pretended, that <hi>Subjects</hi> were bound <hi>to obey <hi>their Prince</hi> without Reſerve,</hi> and to be of his <hi>Religion,</hi> becauſe he would have it ſo. Which was the only Argument that thoſe late <hi>Apoſtles</hi> made uſe of; ſo it is probable this qualification of the duty of <hi>Subjects</hi> was put in here, to prepare us for a terrible <hi>le Roy le veut;</hi> and in that caſe we are told here, that we muſt <hi>obey with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out reſerve;</hi> and when thoſe ſevere Orders come, the <hi>Privy Council,</hi> and all ſuch as exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cute this <hi>Proclamation,</hi> will be bound by this <hi>Declaration</hi> to shew themſelves more for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward than any others, <hi>to obey without re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve:</hi> and thoſe poor pretenſions of <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience, Religion, Honour,</hi> and <hi>Reaſon,</hi> will be then reckoned as <hi>reſerves <hi>upon their obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience,</hi>
               </hi> which are all now shut out.</p>
            <p n="3">III. Theſe being the grounds upon which this <hi>Proclamation</hi> is founded, we ought not only to conſider what conſequences are
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:47954:2"/> now drawn from them, but what may be drawn from them at any time hereafter; for if they are of force, to juſtify that which is now inferred from them, it will be full as juſt to draw from the ſame pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſes an Abolition of the <hi>Proteſtant Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion,</hi> of the Rights of the <hi>Subjects,</hi> not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to <hi>Church-Lands,</hi> but to all <hi>Property</hi> what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever. In a word, it aſſerts a <hi>Power</hi> to be in the <hi>King,</hi> to command what he will, and an Obligation in the <hi>Subjects,</hi> to <hi>obey</hi> what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever he shall <hi>command.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="4">IV. There is alſo mention made in the Preamble of the <hi>Chriſtian Love and Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity,</hi> which his <hi>Majeſty</hi> would have eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blished among <hi>Neighbours;</hi> but another dash of a Pen, founded on this <hi>Abſolute Power,</hi> may declare us all <hi>Hereticks;</hi> and then in wonderful Charity to us, we muſt be told, that we are either <hi>to obey without Reſerve,</hi> or to be <hi>Burnt without Reſerve.</hi> We know the <hi>Charity</hi> of that <hi>Church</hi> pretty well: It is indeed <hi>Fervent</hi> and <hi>Burning:</hi> and if we have forgot what has been done in former Ages, <hi>France, Savoy,</hi> and <hi>Hungary,</hi> have ſet before our eyes very fresh inſtances of the <hi>Charity</hi> of that <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion:</hi> While thoſe Examples are ſo green, it is a little too impoſing on us, to talk to us of <hi>Chriſtian Love and Charity.</hi> No doubt his <hi>Majeſty</hi> means ſincerely, and his Exactneſs to all his <hi>Promiſes,</hi> chiefly to thoſe made ſince he came to the <hi>Crown,</hi> will not ſuffer us to think an unbecoming thought of his Royal Intentions; but yet after all, tho it ſeems by this <hi>Proclamation,</hi> that we are bound to <hi>obey without Reſerve,</hi> it is hardship upon hardship to be bound to <hi>Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve without Reſerve.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="5">V. There are a ſort of People here to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lerated, that will be very hardly found out: and theſe are the <hi>Moderate Presbyterians:</hi> Now, as ſome ſay, that there are very few of thoſe People in <hi>Scotland</hi> that deſerve this Character, ſo it is hard to tell what it amounts to; and the calling any of them <hi>Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moderate,</hi> cuts off all their share in this Grace. <hi>Moderation</hi> is a quality that lyes in the mind, and how this will be found out, I cannot ſo readily gueſs. If a Standard had been given of Opinions or Practices, then one could have known how this might have been diſtinguiſhed; but as it lyes, it will not be eaſy to make the Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crimination; and the declaring them all <hi>Immoderate,</hi> shuts them out quite.</p>
            <p n="6">VI. Another Foundation laid down for repealing all <hi>Laws</hi> made againſt the <hi>Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſts,</hi> is, that they were enacted in <hi>K. James the Sixth</hi>'s Minority: with ſome harsh ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſions, that are not to be inſiſted on, ſince they shew more the heat of the pen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, than the Dignity of the Prince, in whoſe name they are given out; but all theſe <hi>Laws</hi> were ratifyed over and over again by <hi>K. Iames,</hi> when he came to be of full Age: and they have received many Confirmations by <hi>K. Charles the Firſt,</hi> and <hi>K Charles the Second,</hi> as well as by his <hi>preſent Majeſty,</hi> both when he repreſented his <hi>Brother</hi> in the year 1681. and ſince <hi>he</hi> him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf came to the <hi>Crown:</hi> ſo that whatſoever may be ſaid concerning the firſt Formation of thoſe <hi>Laws,</hi> they have received now for the courſe of a whole hundred <hi>years,</hi> that are lapſed ſince <hi>K. Iames</hi> was of full Age, ſo many Confirmations, that if there is any thing certain in Humane Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, we might depend upon them; but this new coyned <hi>Abſolute Power</hi> muſt car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry all before it.</p>
            <p n="7">VII. It is alſo well known, that the whole Settlement of the <hi>Church Lands</hi> and <hi>Tythes,</hi> with many other things, and more particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larly the Eſtablishment of the <hi>Proteſtant Religion,</hi> was likewiſe enacted in <hi>K. Iames</hi>'s minority, as well as thoſe <hi>Penal Laws:</hi> ſo that the Reaſon now made uſe of, to annul the <hi>Penal Laws,</hi> will ſerve full as well for another Act of this <hi>Abſolute Power,</hi> that shall abolish all thoſe; and if Maximes that unhinge all the Securities of Humane Society, and all that is ſacred in Government, ought to be lookt on with the juſteſt and deepeſt prejudices poſſible, one is tempted to loſe the reſpect that is due to every thing that carrys a Royal ſtamp upon it, when he ſees ſuch grounds made uſe of, as muſt shake all Settlements
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:47954:2"/> whatſoever; for if a preſcription of 120. <hi>years,</hi> and Confirmations reiterated over and over again theſe 100. <hi>years</hi> paſt, do not purge ſome Defects in the firſt For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation of thoſe <hi>Laws,</hi> what can make us ſecure: but this looks ſo like a Fetch of the <hi>French Prerogative Law,</hi> both in their pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſes with Relation to the <hi>Edict of Nantes,</hi> and thoſe concerning <hi>Dependences</hi> at <hi>Mets,</hi> that this ſeems to be a Copy from that fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous Original.</p>
            <p n="8">VIII. It were too much ill nature to look into the Hiſtory of the laſt Age, to exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine on what grounds thoſe characters of <hi>pious</hi> and <hi>bleſſed</hi> given to the <hi>Memory</hi> of <hi>Q. Mary</hi> are built; but ſince <hi>K. James</hi>'s <hi>Memory</hi> has the character of <hi>glorious</hi> given to it, if the civility due to the <hi>fair ſex</hi> makes one unwilling to look into the one, yet the other may be a little dwelt on. The pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culiar <hi>Glory</hi> that belongs to <hi>K. James</hi>'s <hi>Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mory,</hi> is, that he was a Prince of great Learning, and that he imployed it chiefly in writing for his <hi>Religion:</hi> of the <hi>Volume</hi> in <hi>folio,</hi> in which we have his <hi>works,</hi> two thirds are againſt the <hi>Church of Rome;</hi> one part of them is a Commentary on the <hi>Reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation,</hi> proving that the <hi>Pope is Antichriſt;</hi> another part of them belonged more natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally to his Poſt and Dignity; which is the warning that he gave to all the Princes and ſtates of <hi>Europe,</hi> againſt the Treaſonable and bloody Doctrines of the <hi>Papacy.</hi> The firſt Act he did when he came of Age, was to ſwear in perſon with all his family, and afterwards with all his people of <hi>Scotland,</hi> a <hi>Covenant,</hi> containing an Enumeration of all the <hi>points</hi> of <hi>Popery,</hi> and a moſt ſolemn renunciation of them, ſomewhat like our <hi>Parliament</hi> Teſt: his <hi>firſt Speech</hi> to the <hi>Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of England</hi> was Copious on the ſame ſubject: and he left a <hi>Legacy</hi> of a <hi>Wish</hi> on ſuch of his <hi>poſterity</hi> as ſhould go over to that <hi>Religion,</hi> which in good manners is ſuppreſſed. It is known, <hi>K. Iames</hi> was no <hi>Conquerour,</hi> and that he made more uſe of his <hi>Pen</hi> than his <hi>Sword:</hi> ſo the <hi>Glory</hi> that is pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culiar to his <hi>Memory</hi> muſt fall chiefly on his Learned and Immortal Writings: and ſince there is ſuch a Veneration expreſſed for him, it agrees not ill with this, to wish, that his <hi>Works</hi> were more ſtudied by thoſe who offer ſuch Incenſe to his <hi>Glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious <hi>Memory.</hi>
               </hi>
            </p>
            <p n="9">IX. His <hi>Maj.</hi> aſſures his people of <hi>Scotland,</hi> upon his <hi>certain knowledge</hi> and <hi>long Experience,</hi> that the <hi>Catholicks,</hi> as they are <hi>good Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans, ſo they are likewiſe Dutiful ſubjects:</hi> but if we muſt believe both theſe equally, then we muſt conclude ſeverely againſt their being <hi>Good Chriſtians;</hi> for we are ſure they can never be <hi>Good Subjects,</hi> not only to a <hi>He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>retical Prince,</hi> but even to a <hi>Catholick Prince,</hi> if he does not <hi>extirpate Hereticks;</hi> for their beloved <hi>Council of the Lateran,</hi> that decreed <hi>Tranſubſtantiation,</hi> has likewiſe decreed, <hi>that if a Prince does not extirpate Hereticks out of his Dominions, the Pope muſt depoſe him, and declare his Subjects abſolved from their Allege<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance, and give his Dominions to another:</hi> So that even His <hi>Majeſty,</hi> how much ſoever he may be a Zealous <hi>Catholick,</hi> yet cannot be aſſured of their fidelity to him, unleſs he has given them ſecret aſſurances, that he is reſolved to <hi>extirpate Hereticks out of his Dominions;</hi> and that all the Promiſes which he now makes to theſe poor wretches are no other way to be kept, than the aſſurances which the <hi>Great Lewis</hi> gave to his <hi>Proteſtant Subjects,</hi> of his obſerving ſtill the <hi>Edict of Nantes</hi> even after he had reſolved to break it, and alſo his laſt promiſe made in the <hi>Edict,</hi> that repealed the <hi>Edict of Nantes,</hi> by which he gave Aſſurances, that no Violence ſhould be uſed to any for their <hi>Religion,</hi> in the very time that he was ordering all poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible Violences to be put in execution againſt them.</p>
            <p n="10">X. His <hi>Majeſty</hi> aſſures us, that on all oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſions the <hi>Papiſts</hi> have ſhewed themſelves <hi>Good and faithfull ſubjects to him and his Royall Predeceſſors;</hi> but how <hi>Abſolute</hi> ſoever the Kings <hi>Power</hi> may be, it ſeems his know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of Hiſtory is not ſo <hi>Abſolute,</hi> but it may be capable of ſome Improvement.

            <p n="13">XIII.

               </hi> It were too great a want of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect to fancy, that a time may come in which even this may be remembred, full as well, as the <hi>Promiſes</hi> that were made to the <hi>Parliament</hi> after His Majeſty came to the <hi>Crown:</hi> I do not, I confeſs, apprehend that; for I ſee here ſo great a caution uſed in the choice of theſe words, that it is plain, very great Severities may very well con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſt with them: It is clear, that the generall words of <hi>Violence</hi> and <hi>Force</hi> are to be deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mined by theſe laſt of <hi>Invincible Neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſity</hi> / ſo that the <hi>King</hi> does only <hi>promiſe</hi> to lay no <hi>Invincible Neceſſity</hi> on his <hi>Subjects;</hi> but for all <hi>Neceſſities,</hi> that are not <hi>Invincible,</hi> it ſeems they muſt expect to bear a large ſhare of them; Diſgraces, want of Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployments, Fines, and Impriſonments, and even Death it ſelf are all <hi>Vincible</hi> things to a man of a firmneſs of mind: ſo that the <hi>Violences of torture,</hi> the <hi>Furies of Dragoons,</hi> and ſome of the <hi>Methods</hi> now practiſed in <hi>France,</hi> perhaps may be Included within this <hi>Promiſe;</hi> ſince theſe ſeem almoſt <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vincible</hi> to humane nature, if it is not for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tified with an Extraordinary meaſure of Grace: but as to all other things, His Majeſty binds himſelf up from no part of <hi>the Exerciſe of his <hi>Abſolute Power</hi>
               </hi> by this Promiſe.</p>
            <p n="15">XV. His <hi>Majeſty</hi> orders this to go Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately to the <hi>Great Seal,</hi> without paſſing thro the other <hi>Seals:</hi> now ſince this is coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter-ſigned by the <hi>Secretary,</hi> in whoſe hands the <hi>Signet</hi> is, there was no other ſtep to be made but thro the <hi>Privy Seal;</hi> ſo I muſt own, I have a great curioſity of knowing his Character in whoſe hands the <hi>Privy Seal</hi> is at preſent; for it ſeems his Conſcience is not ſo very ſupple, as the <hi>Chancellors</hi> and the <hi>Secretaryes</hi> are; but it is very likely, if he does not quickly change his mind, the <hi>Privy Seal</hi> at leaſt will very quickly change its <hi>Keeper;</hi> and I am ſorry to hear, that the <hi>L.

            <p n="16">XVI. Upon the whole matter, many ſmaller things being waved, it being ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tream unpleaſant to find fault, where one has all poſſible diſpoſitions to pay all re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect; we here in <hi>England</hi> ſee what we muſt look for.
